# Vishvam Project - Plot Layout SVG

**Instructions:**

1. Upload your Vishvam layout SVG file to this location:
   `/Users/admin/receipt_app_project_autogravity_ws/static/layouts/vishvam_layout.svg`

2. The SVG should have plot numbers as text labels

3. Once uploaded, the system will:
   - Parse the SVG automatically
   - Extract plot numbers
   - Allow you to add facing/dimensions
   - Display interactive layout with real-time status

**File should be named:** `vishvam_layout.svg`

**Upload the file, then let me know and I'll continue building the features!**
